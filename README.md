# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## The todo tab only works when the user is logged in, so these are the ways to login
You can use one of the default credentials set

user name : ajithgelli23
password : password

Alternatively, once you register yourself with your own credentials, you can directly go to todo tab to add.
